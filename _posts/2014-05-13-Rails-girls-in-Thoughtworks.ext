Rails girls is an event to give tools for women to understand technology. It does this by providing a great first experience on building the internet. The attendees do not need any previous knowledge about programmming and there are no age-limitations. Thoughtworks started to organize rails girls event from 2012.

<p>		
			Rails girls events are non-profit, the participants and coaches or speakers are not paid. Thoughtworks try to contribute to IT diversity, try to remove bias of women in IT, try to give equal opportunity to women who are interested in programming. This is one of the three pillars of Thoughtworks -- social and economic justice.

			For participants, with or without programming background, they can build a website by themselves after this event; There will be session sharing about basic knowledge of website building, rails framework and ruby language; There will be work shop to use ruby and rails by themselves and mistake corrected by coachs, in which way, participants will learn very fast. By the way, we have enough coaches, one coach is only supposed to have 1~3 coachees.
